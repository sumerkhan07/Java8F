Anonymous Class in Java

An anonymous class is a class without a name that is declared and instantiated at the same time.
Itâ€™s usually used to override methods of an interface or an abstract class without creating a separate named class.

âœ… Key Points
Defined using new keyword.
Used when a class is needed only once.
Can implement an interface or extend a class.
Cannot have a constructor (since it has no name).
Useful in GUI event handling, Threads, or quick logic.

What is an Anonymous Class in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Answer: An anonymous class in Java is an unnamed inner class that is declared and instantiated simultaneously.
It is commonly used to provide an immediate implementation of an abstract class or an interface, especially when the 
implementation is required only once.


Example
package Java8;
interface Anos{
	public void name();
	}
public class FP {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Anos a= new Anos() {
			@Override
			public void name() {
				System.out.println("I am from the main method");
			}
		};
		
		a.name();
	}

}
